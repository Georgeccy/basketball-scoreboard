# [Basketball Scoreboard](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend/solo-project-pro-basketball-scoreboard-cz9adVfP)

Requirements:

- Build it from scratch
- Follow the design
- Make all 6 buttons work

Stretch Goals:

- Add “New Game” button
- Highlight the leader
- Add other counters (fouls, periods, timer, etc.)

Basic JavaScript concepts taught

[x] Declaring and initializing variables with let
[x] Variable reassignment
[x] Data types: number, string
[x] CamelCase convention for variable names
[x] Basic math operations
[x] Logging to the console
[x] getElementById()
[x] Basic exposure to writing a function *(no parameters or arguments yet)*
[x] Calling/invoking a function
[x] Inline onclick() event listener (students haven’t yet learned about addEventListener())
[x] Basic intro to the DOM
[x] .textContent 

## What youve done well
- met all core and stretch goals. Great job!
- applied core concepts taught in the course.
- good understanding of classes e.g. <div class="btn-group">
- used custom font
- understand how to use flex and its various properties
- margin: 0 auto to center block level elements

## What could be improved
- avoid using ID selectors to style elements in CSS. Find out more about specificity in module 6, or read this article: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_specificity.asp
- don't use underscores in variable names. use hyphens -
- use hover effects to give user feedback on interactive elements

## Your question: how to use CSS variables
 * declare them in :root {}
 * use variable names that describe their **function** , not their value e.g. --primaryColor, --accent etc.
 
## Challenge: refactoring to make the code DRYer with parameters and arguments
